# Security Testing Repository

## Overview
This repository contains intentionally vulnerable code designed to test AI-powered IDE tools and security scanners. The codebase serves as a testing ground to evaluate the effectiveness of various security analysis tools in detecting vulnerabilities.

## Purpose
- Test AI-powered IDE tools' ability to detect security vulnerabilities. You can prompt the Agent to `What are the vulnerabilities in my code`.
- Evaluate security scanners' effectiveness in identifying common security issues
- Provide a controlled environment for security testing
- Serve as a reference for understanding common security vulnerabilities
- Continuously expand with new vulnerabilities and security test cases over time
- Demonstrate how sensitive environment variables can be exposed through `.env` files in version control (intentionally included to test security scanners)
